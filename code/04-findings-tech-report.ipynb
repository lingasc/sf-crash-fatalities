    "# Why This Model and Approach?\n",

    "\n",
    "- Handles complex relationships: Gradient boosting can capture non-linear relationships between features and target variables, which is crucial for modeling complex traffic patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature importance: Naturally provides insights into which features are most predictive of fatality risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Robust to outliers: Gradient boosting is less affected by outliers than many other algorithms, important for geospatial data that may contain anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Good performance with mixed data types: Works well with both categorical and numerical data after appropriate preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles imbalanced data well: Can learn effectively even when one class (high-risk or low-risk) is more frequent in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Feature Set?\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected features combine important dimensions that influence traffic fatality risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spatial components (latitude/longitude): Location is critical for understanding risk patterns across different areas of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temporal patterns (hour, month, day of week): Fatalities often follow patterns based on time of day, seasonality, and weekly rhythms (e.g., weekday vs. weekend).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Road user type (collision_category): Different road users (pedestrians, cyclists, vehicle occupants) face different risks.\n",

    "# Alternative Models Not Chosen\n",
    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "  \n",
    "While simpler to interpret, logistic regression would likely miss complex non-linear relationships and interactions between features in traffic fatality data. The spatial and temporal factors often have complex interrelationships that gradient boosting can better capture.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Neural Networks\n",
    "  \n",
    "Would require more data to perform well, add significant complexity, be more prone to overfitting with this dataset size, and provide less inherent interpretability (important for traffic safety analysis where understanding risk factors is crucial).\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Random Forest\n",

    "- Precision: Measures how many predicted high-risk areas are actually high-risk.\n",
    "- Recall: Measures how many actual high-risk areas were correctly identified.\n",

    "- Ensure we don't miss areas that truly need intervention (recall)\n",

    "This measures the model's ability to discriminate between high and low-risk cases across various threshold settings. I chose this because:  \n",

    "- It's threshold-independent, allowing evaluation of the model's performance regardless of where the classification cutoff is set\n",
    "- It's particularly useful for imbalanced datasets where one class might be more prevalent\n",

    "  \n",
    "- For traffic safety applications, knowing why an area is high-risk is as important as knowing that it's high-risk\n",
